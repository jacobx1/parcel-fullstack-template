- Parcel

Just clone this repo and start updating

## Getting started

First, clone this repo. Then, in the root of the repo, run `yarn`. Now you're ready to start development.

To start the client and server dev servers, run `yarn start` from the root. Now whenever client or server code is updated, the affected components will update. Client code will update with Parcel's HMR - server code will restart via `ts-node-dev`.

Hope this helps make it faster to get an idea started!
